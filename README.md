# Trajectory Planning Optimization
Basic code modules for performance-criteria-based trajectory planning for future implementation in the robot Yu. The repository consists mainly of:

* Robot kinematics and dynamics (originally written in C)
* An auto-editor that converts C codes into python script
* Robotictoolbox code package for python
* Filterpy & Kalman-Filter for trajectory optimization
* Example codes for heuristic Kalman algorithm (matlab & python)
