# Trajectory Planning Optimization
Basic code modules for performance-criteria-based trajectory planning for future implementation in the robot Yu. The repository consists of:

* Robot kinematics and dynamics (originally written in C)
* An auto-editor that converts C codes into python script
* Codes for robot energy calculation and optimization using Kalman algorithm
* Codes for force & momentum-limited optimization
* Optimization results (simulation and robot logs)

# Before running the codes
The following packages need to be installed to run the codes

* Robotics Toolbox for Python

```shell script
pip3 install roboticstoolbox-python
```
